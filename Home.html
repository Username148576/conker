            Sports Science is an interdisciplinary study that may cover the research areas of kinematics, medical rehabilitation, sports psychology, information and communication technology, sensing technology, automation technology, etc. and is turnkey to the development of coaching and training systems and knowledge for professional athletes. In the last decade, the so-called precision sports science has emphasized the use of scientific data analysis with the assistance of modern ICT to provide efficient and effective teaching, learning, and training, increase the convenience and entertainment of sports participation, and improve sports performance. The goal is to increase the population of sports participation, improve the national health level, enhance the performance of elite athletes, and create value in the sports industry.
            <br/><br/>Intelligent Technologies are the turnkey of precision sports science. Intelligent applications are composed of at least three functionalities, including sensing, decision-making, and response. Domain knowledge is necessary and important in cross-disciplinary research, and technology integration is unavoidable in the innovation of intelligent service. The workshop will emphasize the following aspects of sports research and applications, including

        <h2>
            Sensing Technology
        </h2>
        <p class="fp">
            Data is the driving force of progress of current intelligent technology development. Sensing technology is an important capability to collect data from the real world, including wearable devices such as IMU, ECG, EMG, EEG, smart bracelets, computer vision such as photography systems, Vicon, dynamic photography technology, Dynamic vision sensors, and other sensing devices such as force plates, pressure sensors, mobile devices are which can provide more possibilities for intelligent technology.

        <h2>
            Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making Technologies
        </h2>
        <p class="fp">
            Refers to the ability to extract knowledge from data, such as big data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, etc. Through data understanding of sports performance and key factors, it can be used as a reference for teaching and sports learning, and also as an interactive basis and reference for decision making.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Interactive Technology
        </h2>
        <p class="fp">
            How the computer systems respond to the external world, through automation machinery (e.g., robots), multimedia visual presentation (e.g. charts, AR/VR/MR, etc.), to develop training assistant tools, enhance teaching and learning efficiency, provide convenient sports environment, or elevate entertainment effects brought by motions.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Smart Sports Applications
        </h2>
        <p class="fp">
            Solutions proposed for sports learning, teaching, professional guidance, tactical analysis, sports injury prevention, and rehabilitation are closely related to the domain know-how of sports with the use of intelligent technology.
        </p>
        <h2>
            ICT for Sport
        </h2>
        <p class="fp">
            New technologies that contribute to the development of sports science and engineering, such as 5G/6G communication, network technology, e-sport, social media, human-machine interface, parallel computing, etc.
